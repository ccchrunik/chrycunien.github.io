# SDN Overview

Q: Why we need SDN?
A: Network is versatile, we need more flexibility to solve a number of problems
For example:
- Media Network: Medium Throughput, High Stablity
- IoT Network: Low throughput, Low Latency
- File Network: High Throughput
- ...

Each router contains a flow table that is computed and distributed by a logically centralized routing controller.

Besides, SDN splits the network device structure into 3 layers:
- Vertically Integrated --> Horizontal
- Closed, Proprietary --> Open Interfaces
- Slow Innovation --> Rapid Innovation
- Small Industry --> Huge Industry
