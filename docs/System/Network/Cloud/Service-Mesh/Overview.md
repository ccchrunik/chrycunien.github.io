# Overview

## Features
- Service Mesh has 3 main features: Reliability, Security, and Observability
- The value of the service mesh is that it provides us those features at the platform layer rather than at the application layer.
- Service Mesh serves as a proxy service that talks to another service, which also contains data plane and control plane.
