# Ubuntu setup

This is some additional step you need to do if you use Ubuntu. My current version is 20.04 LTS.

## Additional Setup
The basic setup is the same as the general setup, but you have to install some vim prerequisite.

Make sure you install some vim requirement (for ubuntu)
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install vim-gui-common
$ sudo apt-get install vim-runtime
```
